In memory of Michael Inggs - thank you for providing the necessary information for starting the project. The technical data, notes and videos that you sent to me at the beginning of the project were a lamp on the path to completing the project. Your guidance allowed me to push until the very end.

To my supervisor, Dr Stephen Paine, thank you for pushing me to reach my full potential and completing this research project. I am truly grateful for showing me what it means to be a good engineer. 

To my teachers who shared their knowledge along my academic journey, thank you for the great work that you continue to do in opening doors to a brighter future. 

Thank you to my friends Thato Makhubedu and Ditiro Nkuna for their help when I did not have a place to stay while writing this report. Thank you to Steve Jermy, whose advice allowed me to remain in the city long enough to complete the project.

To God and my mother, thank you for applying the patience that was required to mould me into the person that I am today.
